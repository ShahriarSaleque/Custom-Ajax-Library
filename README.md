# Custom-Ajax-Library
A customized Ajax Library that can be used to make get put post and delete API calls built using callback , Promises and Async/Await seperately

easyHttp.js --> Library made using callbacks
easyHttp2.js --> Library made using Promises
easyHttp3.js --> Library made using async/await

app.js --> file to be used to test out the library 

Here I have implemented the jsonPlaceholder fake online rest API ("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/") to test out the library.
